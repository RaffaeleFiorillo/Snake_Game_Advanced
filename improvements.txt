world should draw a black square only in the position where the last part of the snake was, in the previous frame.
this would make the complexity of the world-drawing-algorithm go from quadratic to constant!

note: for this solution to work, the world must be initially fully drawn.
      mantain the initial implementation and compare it with optimized

do the same for the snake's body. so that even when it grows it doesn't have to draw all the body parts, but
only the one at the back of the head.
